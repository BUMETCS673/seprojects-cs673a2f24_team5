# CVCoach

An artifical intelligence tool powered by the ???. It can provide several services for job seekers, interviewers and HRs, such as refining the CV, mocking interviews and writing questions based on resumes.

## Task Management

As per github's task tracking flow is difficult to use, we decide to use Notion's KanBan to trace the progress and manage the risk.
